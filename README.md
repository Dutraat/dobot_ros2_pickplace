# ü§ñ Robotic Manipulation Scenario with Dobot Magician + ROS 2

This repository is part of a **research project in collaborative robotics**, aiming to develop an **experimental robotic manipulation scenario** using the **Dobot Magician** robotic arm integrated with **ROS 2 (Humble)** and **Python**.

In this experiment, the Dobot Magician will be trained to recognize objects moving on a **conveyor belt**, determine their positions within its workspace, and autonomously perform **pick-and-place** operations, depositing them in predefined locations.  

The system combines **physical robotics**, **computer vision**, **simulation in RViz/Dobot Studio**, and intelligent control algorithms, serving as a foundation for research in **automation and robot learning**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Create an **experimental robotic scenario** with the Dobot Magician.  
- Implement object recognition for items moving on a conveyor belt.  
- Estimate object positions within the robot‚Äôs workspace using sensors/computer vision.  
- Program the Dobot to perform **pick-and-place** according to sorting criteria.  
- Use **ROS 2 + Python** as the integration and control framework.  
- Validate experiments in **simulation (RViz, Dobot Studio)** before running on real hardware.
